<h1>Building Intution for DNS and Implementing Network file sharing</h1>

In this project, I will be combining two key areas: DNS management and network file sharing. The focus is on practical application of DNS record configuration and understanding DNS caching, as well as establishing and managing network file shares with various permission levels. This approach integrates core networking concepts with hands-on experience in system administration, showcasing my ability to manage and troubleshoot essential network services in a cohesive manner. <br />


<h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Various Command-Line Tools
- Active Directory

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows 10 (21H2)
